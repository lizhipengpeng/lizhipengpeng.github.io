<h2 id="title-期刊"><a href="#title-期刊" class="headerlink" title="title:期刊"></a>title:期刊</h2><p>MIS领域的国际顶级期刊公认的最顶级三大期刊是 MIS Quarterly(MISQ), Management Science(MS)和Information Systems Research(ISR)。此外，Journal of Management Information Systems(JMIS),INFORMS Journal on Computing,Communications of ACM也很厉害，仅次于三大公认。其余比较好的有Journal of the Association for Information Systems ,Decison Support Systems(DSS), Information &amp; Management, Journal of Strategic Information Systems……….很多，就不一一列举了。</p>
<p>中文期刊方面，《管理世界》是公认管理学领域最顶级中文期刊，《科研管理》、《南开管理评论》、《管理科学学报》等次之，都是管理学中文一流期刊。稍微次之的有《管理科学》、《管理工程学报》等。</p>
<p>期刊的影响因子每年都变，但排名也会小幅变化，但在学科的地位短时间内一般不变。在一段时间内，排名靠前的期刊依然排名靠前。</p>
<p>附件是计算机领域的学术会议等级排名情况，分为A+, A, B, C, L 共5个档次。其中A+属于顶级会议，基本是这个领域全世界大牛们参与和关注最多的会议。国内的研究者能在其中发表论文的话，是很值得骄傲的成就。</p>
<p>A类也是非常好的会议了，尤其是一些热门的研究方向，A类的会议投稿多录用率低，部分A类会议影响力逐步逼近A+类会议。B类的会议分两种，一种称为盛会级，参与的人多，发表的论文也多，论文录用难度比上两个级别要低很多，通常是行业内的学者们年度交流的好时机。一种是专业级的小会，圈子往往比较小，但是也有一些相对质量不错的成果发表。另外B类也是一个分水岭，是区分NB成果和普通成果的分界线，往下的C类会议知名度就低很多了，而L级的会议更多。如果不是为了注水，而是追求论文的质量多过数量的话，不建议在L级会议上发表论文。除此以外计算机还有更多的会议不在列表内，这些属于更不入流的会议了</p>
